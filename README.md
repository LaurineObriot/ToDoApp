# ToDoApp

My first ToDoApp, to train to use javascript and learn to make a responsive site.

This is my first personal project, I decided to challenge myself using JavaScript, a language I had some preconceptions about. Finally, I succeeded what I wanted to do, I had planned 1 week for this project, but I finally put twice as much.
